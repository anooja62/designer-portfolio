    "bio": "Okay, so design wasn’t always part of the plan. I started out as a computer science grad with a deep interest in logic and structure. But somewhere between writing code and solving user problems, I discovered the world of design — and I haven’t looked back since.\nDesign felt natural. It blended creativity with structure, empathy with problem-solving. I realized I could impact how people feel, move, and interact — just by designing intentionally.\nNow, I view the world through a designer’s lens. From mobile apps to SaaS dashboards, every detail matters. Each pixel, button, and flow tells a story — and I love being part of that story. Whether I’m working on a healthcare app, an eCommerce platform, or a CRM tool, my mission stays the same: design experiences that work beautifully and feel effortless.\nEvery project is a new challenge, a chance to learn something new, to explore better ways to solve real problems. That’s what fuels me as a designer.",
